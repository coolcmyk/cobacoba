[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findthruster_manager.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "thruster_manager", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "thruster_manager"
  with any of the following names:

    thruster_managerConfig.cmake
    thruster_manager-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "thruster_manager" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "thruster_manager_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "thruster_manager" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
